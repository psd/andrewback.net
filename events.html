		<p><a href="/works/Time-for-Tea">Time for Tea?</a> was installed at the <a href="http://www.kinetica-artfair.com">Kinetica Art Fair</a>, 3rd - 6th February 2011, London. <a href="/works/VIR">VIR</a> badges were on sale in the Kinetica shop.</p>

		<blockquote>Andrew Back describes 'Time for Tea' as a satirisation of the British sense of impotence when the nation meets complex global problems and the typically English way of dealing with them. He's seamlessly customized a 1950's voltmeter to measure real time fluctuations in the National Grid power supply to indicate the best, and worst, time to put the kettle on - <a href="http://www.artvehicle.com/events/295">Artvehicle 54/Review</a>, By Phil Harris</blockquote>

		<blockquote>The traditional British response to anything happening is, of course, a cup of tea. Andrew Back... was showing Time for Tea? It uses the same principles that power stations have to monitor surges and looks like it came straight out of a school science lab in the 50s or 60s. ‘ Steady on!’ indicates when it measures a power supply deficit, while a surplus makes it point to ‘ More Tea?’ - <a href="http://www.fadwebsite.com/2011/02/04/kinetica-art-fair-from-friday-feb-4th-2011-a-review-from-herbert-wright/">FAD: Kinetica Art Fair Review</a>, By Herbert Wright</blockquote>

		<blockquote>You needn’t expect a lot of rambling speculation about what the world will be like when we are all cyborgs; a lot of the work on show provides a more subtle foil for organic life. Andrew Back’s ‘Time for tea’ is a vintage voltmeter that provides a live reading of the power deficit or surplus in the national grid, which as we all know, is determined by the amount of people making tea at any one time - <a href="http://www.forteantimes.com/features/commentary/5095/kinetica_art_fair.html">ForteanTimes: Kinetica Art Fair</a>, By Jim Bond</blockquote>

		<blockquote>In a work currently on display at the Watermans Gallery, hacker Andrew Back has turned John Foxx's slice of 1980's electronica Dr No into a sequence of numbers. Gallery visitors are encouraged to write down the numbers on a paper pad thus transforming the work from one form to another

		<blockquote>Over at the Horse Hospital, DNA was a short art exhibition in praise of and inspired by the pioneering work of John Foxx. Rather than a retrospective, all the work here was contemporary and featured a blend of the analogue and the digital... Most interesting to me was Andrew Back’s No Numbers which breaks down the 3’18” of Foxx’s own Mr No into sets of numerically displayed digital samples that, if transcribed on the paper provided at the rate of one number per second, would take four weeks to transcribe - <a href="/press/Inpress180809.pdf">Inpress, 18th August 2009</a>, By James McGalliard</blockquote>
