		<h2>Lumen Spiritus Sancti</h2> 
		<p>Media: electric light, cable, electronics.</p>
		<p> Lumen Spiritus Sancti begins with a field recording made in the control room of Battersea Power Station using the iterative process developed by Alvin Lucier for his piece "I am sitting in a room" (1969).</p>
		<p>The source material is a performance of a séance in which the spirits of the place are entreated to reveal themselves. This recording is repeatedly played in the control room and re-recorded, played and re-recorded. After many iterations, the result is distorted beyond recognition but encodes the unique acoustic properties of that space.</p>
		<p>In the installation this final recording is amplified until it is powerful enough to illuminate a solitary mains light bulb. The sympathetic flicker of the fragile light links back to the room where the recording was made and provides a visual representation of something previously unseen, and unheard since the days when the power station was in full operation.</p>
		<p>The viewer is provided with a small receiver and headphones to wear, then encouraged to "walk towards the light". As they do so the cycle is completed: energy emitted from the bulb is converted back to sound and they are presented with the control room's response to the séance.</p>
		<p>The piece explores the sacred-profane dichotomy and the blurring of this distinction through a process of consecration and de-consecration reflected in the feedback cycles of reproduction and representation. The installation is also a cenotaph for the engineers who built the power station and worked there.</p>
