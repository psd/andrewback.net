		<p>The direct current flowing in a conductor is directly
proportional to the potential difference between its ends.<br/><em>Statement of Ohm’s Law</em></p>
		<p>There is no certainty when or from what source Cavendish inherited the riches that ultimately came into his possession. All the testimony, however, agrees on two cardinal facts: that Cavendish was, for the first forty years of his life a poor man, and for the last thirtynine
an exceedingly rich one.<br/><em>“Henry Cavendish”, Charles K Edmunds, 1901</em></p>
		<p>[Ohm’s Die galvanische Kette, mathematisch bearbeitet] is a web of naked fancies, which can never find the semblance of support from even the most superficial observation of facts; (and) he who looks on the world with the eye of reverence must turn aside from this [...] as the result of an incurable delusion, whose sole effort is to detract from the dignity of nature.<br/><em>“History of Physics”, Florian Cajori, 1929, quoting a nameless
critic</em></p>
		<p>Centuries later, the opprobrium that greeted Ohm’s publication seems baffling and the disproportionate savagery of the critique certainly took its toll on Ohm’s psyche. Black moods become commonplace; he finds it impossible to concentrate; he is possessed by the notion that a “secret society” is operating in the shadows to suppress his research for its own inscrutable ends.<br/><em>“Georg Ohm: A life in science”, Elijah Lowell, 1974</em></p>
		<p>I have, through my own investigations, uncovered many of the electrical principles that are the keystone of the Cavendish philosophy. I am already halfenlightened! Yet, at the behest of The Society, I have said nothing and published nothing. [...] Over and again, I have proved my obedience and adaptability for the sake of The Society. Indeed, the only thing in which I have been determined and inflexible has been in the prosecution of my studies [...] My sex cannot be an obstacle. My petition to be admitted must be heard. I will not be denied.<br/><em>Letter to Charles Babbage, Mary Greig, 1834</em></p>
		<p>Cavendish never married and was reputed to have a positive dislike for women. In the words of one of his contemporaries, “he was the coldest and most indifferent of mortals.” [...] Another authority relates that Cavendish “one day met a maid servant on the stairs with a broom and pail, and was so annoyed that he immediately ordered a back staircase to be built.”<br/><em>“Henry Cavendish”, Charles K Edmunds, 1901</em></p>
		<p>There have been only three women who have understood me. These are yourself Mrs Somerville, Caroline Herschel and a Mrs Grieg of whom I know nothing.<br/><em>“Calendar of the Correspondence of Pierre Simon Laplace” Berkeley Papers in the History of Science, vol.8, 1982</em></p>
		<p>One idea after another, of those which constitute the basis of science, becomes distinct, first in the minds of discoverers, then in the minds of all cultured men, till a general clearness of thought illuminates the land; and thus the torch of knowledge is handed forwards, thousands upon thousands lighting their lamps as it passes on; while still from time to time some new Prometheus catches a fresh light from heaven, to spread about among men in a like manner.<br/><em>“On the Principles of an English University Education” William Whewell, 1837</em></p>
